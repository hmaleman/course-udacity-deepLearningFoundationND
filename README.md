# Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree
## Course outline
### Lesson 5 - Regression
Learn about linear regression and logistic regression models. These simple machine learning models are the building blocks of neural networks.
### Lesson 7 - Intro to Neural Networks
Intro on Logistic Regression and Neural Networks. Implementation of Gradient Descent and Backpropagation.
### Lesson 8 - Neural Nets
- Project 1: Your first Neural Network - Build a Neural Network with Numpy (without library support) defining "by hand" forward pass and backward propagation pass. Tune the model's hyperparemeters.
