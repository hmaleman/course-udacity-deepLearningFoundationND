# Your First Neural Network
### Description
Build a neural network for a bike sharing prediction model (real dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)). 
Goals:
- Not use a NN library support, only numpy.
- Code forward and backpropagation pass.
- Tune hyperparameters.

### Environment
- python 3
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib
